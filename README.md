embed all dependencies into a single html file

a new form of offline, OS agnostic, browser based application

put the wasm in the base64 lil bro

## features
- [x] text
- [x] png
- [x] wasm simple
- [x] wasm-bindgen
- [x] wasm canvas
- [x] wasm bevy
- [x] loading screen steps
- [x] indexedDB during first time load, cache wasm_modules as u8
- [ ] library api
- [ ] test suite
- [x] metadata
- [x] favicon svg
- [ ] favicon all
- [ ] lazy loading
- [x] brotli compression
- [ ] wasm advanced
- [ ] cli tool
- [ ] mcp
- [ ] ~~skip compilation~~
- [ ] ~~base94 (slowww...)~~
- [ ] base122 (in rust)
- [x] instanced mesh custom render shader pipeline
- [ ] auto webgpu turn on -> webgl2 fallback (storage buffer = bad)
- [ ] error on webgpu not found
- ???

With these current implemented features, we have a solid backbone for the htmlpacker. future iterations will depend on optimized base94 encode/decode. Right now it is too slow to be practical.

## todo
- [x] fps counter
- [x] encode textures
- [x] encode models/meshes/3d
- [ ] simple asset loader for textures
- asset loader for models
- basis universal 
- encode fonts
- big png
- new animation
- basic game
- single wasm-binary self loading

## compile
wasm: `wasm-pack build --target no-modules`

## notes
what computer you compile on will leak bevy crate stuff, how to prevent?

```js
const wasmModule = await WebAssembly.compile(wasmBytes);
wasmBytes = wasmModule;

//Error:  DataCloneError: Failed to execute 'put' on 'IDBObjectStore': A WebAssembly.Module can not be serialized for storage.
```
- browser protects against caching compiled output
- would cause errors if wasm runtime and cached output mismatch
